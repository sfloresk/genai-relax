# GenAI Relaxing UI

Example user interface to show generated descriptions and images. 

The interface allows you to select three available topics, but can be extended to any other topic with just a few lines of HTML and Javascript. Once a topic is selected, the UI will query for descriptions and images indefinitely, allowing the user to see as many images as needed.

The use cases for this project can go from helping users to reduce anxiety (concentrating in the images), creating memory games (which can be used to evaluate cognitive decline) and even for education (e.g., showing geometric images and asking children to identify which shape is in the screen)
Lastly, an audio description plays per image as an example of how to make the website more accessible
